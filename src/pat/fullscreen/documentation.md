## Description

The *fullscreen* pattern allows you to display any element in fullscreen-mode.

## Documentation

When the ``pat-fullscreen`` link is clicked, the element which the anchor-link refers to in it's ``href`` attribute is sent to fullscreen.
A link with the class ``fullscreen-exit`` is added to the element which is sent to fullscreen and removed when exiting fullscreen-mode.

### Examples

    <a href="#fs1" class="pat-fullscreen">Open fullscreen</a>
    <section id="fs3">
      <h2>Example</h2>
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/600"/>
    </section>
