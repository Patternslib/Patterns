Features

```

- pat-push: New pattern for replacing html content on push events.
- pat-scroll-box: New pattern for scrolling detection. Replaces the previous "scroll detection" module.
- pat-inject: Rename undocumented ``selector`` property to ``defaultSelector``.
- pat-inject: Fix typo in docs for the ``source`` property.
- pat-scroll: Implement new special `selector:top` attribute value to scroll the scroll container just to the top of the page. Ref: #721.
- pat-scroll: To define the scrollable target search also for `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` declarations.
- Rework push message support for the STOMP message protocoll instead of backends instead of WAMP.
  We are using the RabbitMQ message broker for push support instead of crossbar.io.
- Navigation:
  - Do not set the ``.navigation-in-path`` class for elenents already marked with ``.current``.
  - Allow configuration of "in path" and "current" classes via ``in-path-class`` and ``current-class`` configuration options.
  - Allow empty ``in-path-class`` which then does not set the in-path class.
  - Allow configuration of ``item-wrapper`` element on which ``in-path-class`` or ``current-class`` are set. Defaults to ``li``.
  - Set current class also on parent item-wrapper if not set.
  - Fix case where current class was not set when not present on load.
  - Set current class also when DOM elements are inserted or removed.
- Add ``utils.getCSSValue`` for retrieving CSS property values for DOM nodes.
- Add configurable scrolling behavior to pat-inject.
- Add ``webpack-visualizer-plugin`` for analyzation of generated bundles.
- Fix ``pat-auto-scale`` not correctly rescaling after fullscreen changes. Fixes #673
- Use node-sass as suggested by https://sass-lang.com/install - the ruby version is deprecated.
- Use ``yarn`` instead of ``npm``.
- Use babel for all files, allowing latest JavaScript features everywhere.
- Add ``pat-fullscreen`` pattern to allow any element to be displayed in fullscreen-mode.
  A second pattern ``pat-fullscreen-close`` which is triggered on ``close-fullscreen`` CSS class allows for closing the fullscreen with custom buttons.
- Runs now on jQuery 3.
- Integrated pat-display-time from https://github.com/ploneintranet/pat-display-time
- Fixed an issue with pat-scroll when placed on an item without a href

## 2.1.1 - Aug. 28, 2017

Fixes

```

- pat-modal: Only add a panel-header to the first panel-content element within pat-modal, not everyone. Otherwise this may collide with pat-collapsible which also creates a panel-content class further down the DOM (pilz)

## 2.1.0 - Jun. 26, 2017

- pat-gallery: Also include the node with the ``pat-gallery`` class trigger for initializing the gallery.
  Now ``pat-gallery`` can be used on anchor tags wrapping images directly, making it possible to let images be opened individually in in the overlay without adding them to a gallery with navigation controls to the next image.
- fix input-change-events for <input type="number" />
- pat-autosubmit: allow nested autosubmitting subforms with different delays.
- pat-masonry: Initialize masonry just before layouting gets startet, which is after first image has been loaded or at loading has finished. This avoids overlapping images while they are still being loaded.
- pat-masonry: fix layout of nested .pat-masonry elements
- pat-gallery: UX improvements - do not close on scroll or pinch.
- pat-gallery: UX improvements - remove scrollbars when gallery is opened.
- pat-gallery: add option ``item-selector`` for gallery items, which are added to the gallery.
  Defaults to ``a``.
  Fixes situations, when gallery items and normal links are mixed within the same container and normal links would open within the gallery lightbox.
- Update to jQuery 1.11.3.
- While images are loading, already do masonry layouting.
- Remove the ``clear-imagesloaded-cache`` trigger, as cache functionality was removed from imagesloaded from version 3.2.0.
  See: https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded/issues/103#issuecomment-152152568
- Change ``imagesloaded`` from usage of jQuery plugin to vanilla JavaScript to avoid timing errors, where the ``imagesloaded`` plugin wasn't available.
- Update ``masonry`` and ``imagesloaded`` plugins.
- Fix ``pat-gallery`` to work with ``requirejs-text`` instead ``requirejs-tpl-jcbrand``.
  Fixes an obscure "window undefined" error.
  Backwards incompatible change: The ``photoswipe-template`` RequireJS configuration variable is removed and a the ``pat-gallery-url`` variable is defined instead.
- always recalculate masonry also at the very end, even if there are no images to be loaded
- Fix a bug in pat-scroll that would only properly leave nav items alone if their urls end in a slash
- An href can also contain a url left of the hashmark. pat-scroll should only care for the part right of the hashmark
- Issue a delayed redraw of the calendar to prevent rendering race conditions
- make list of calendar categories unique to speed up js processing on sites with many calendars.

## 2.0.12 - Oct. 9, 2015

- New property for the inject pattern: `loading-class`.
  Specifies a class to appear on the injection target while the injected content is still loading.
  Previously this was hardcoded to `injecting`, this is still set to the default value.
- New propertys for the inject pattern: `confirm` and `confirm-message`.
  Allows you to specify whether a confirmation message should be shown before
  injecting, as well as the text of that message.

- Markdown pattern:

  - Generate HTML5 `<section>` elements with a `<h1>` header when converting
    headers. This fixes [ticket

  - Support filtering if injected markdown documents with headers using
    underlined (equal signs or dashes) style notation.

  - Update the version of
    [pagedown-extra](https://github.com/jmcmanus/pagedown-extra) which could
    case markdown constructs to be replaces with the word `undefined`. This
    fixes [ticket 297](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/297).

- Injection pattern: extend *autoload-in-visible* to also apply for situations
  where we are not dealing with a heigh-constrained scrollable parent but need
  to look at the entire page.

    and jquery.select2 in our demos to prevent unexpected changes. Instead we
    now use a copy we can update as needed.

  - Rewrite top level makefile:

    - Update the bungles if `packages.json` has changed.
    - Move jshint out to a new `jshint` target. This is automatically invoked
      when running `make check`, but is skipped when you only want to run
      the unittests.

- Modify included HTML pages to use modules instead of bundles. This makes
  development easier by removing the need to always rebuild bundles.

- Add new [slide pattern](demo/slides/index.html).
  (Wichert Akkerman)

    266](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/266) (Wichert Akkerman)

- Check-list pattern: send *change* event when a checkbox is toggled. This fixes

    [Ticket 268](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/268)
    (Wichert Akkerman)

  - Make sure we correctly identify autoloaded markdown content referenced from
    a just-injected HTML fragment.
    [Ticket 188](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/188)
    (Wichert Akkerman)

  - Use a new markdown converter for every pattern. This fixes problems with
    shared converter state if the pattern tried to convert two pieces of
    markdown at the exact same time.
    (Wichert Akkerman)

- Placeholder pattern: remove Modernizr dependency.
  (Wichert Akkerman)

- Sortable pattern: fix weird behaviour when element is dropped on self.
  (Markoi Đurković)

- Core logic changes:

  - Patterns main.js returns registry, you have to call patterns.init()
    manually. For the bundles this happens automatically. Depend on
    `patterns/autoinit`, if you really want an auto-initializing modular
    patterns library. (Florian Friesdorf)

  - Registry: Add option to registry.scan to let init exceptions
    through. (Rok Garbas)

  - Registry: rescans the DOM for patterns registered after the initial
    DOM scan. (Florian Friesdorf)

  - Include pattern name in the parser log output. This makes it much easier to
    debug problems. (Wichert Akkerman)

  - HTML parser:

    - Correctly handle tag and attribute names containing a colon.
      (Wichert Akkerman)

    - Correct escaping of double quotes in attribute values.
      (Wichert Akkerman)

## 1.1.0 - Released February 7, 2013

- bumper pattern fetches DOM info in event handler, not only during init.
  [Ticket 232](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/232). (Marko Đurković)

- pat/ajax to handle anchors and forms, supersedes lib/ajax (Florian Friesdorf, Marko Đurković)
  including:
  [Ticket 148](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/148).

- pagedown 1.1.0 and pagedown-extra with code in table support (Marko Đurković,
  Florian Friesdorf)
  [Ticket 252](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/252).

- edit-tinymce independent of ajax (Marko Đurković)

- input-change events used by autosubmit and form-state (Marko Đurković)

- Bring back API documentation (Wichert Akkerman)

- Website improvements content/design (cornae)

- Improved support for custom bundles (still experimental)
  [Ticket 227](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/227). (Marko Đurković)
  [Ticket 235](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/235). (Marko Đurković)

- testrunner support on nixos (Florian Friesdorf)

- experimental support for yet undocumented `data-pat-inject="history:
  record"`. (Marko Đurković)

- Generate test runners for modules and bundles ourselves, removing
  dependency on grunt. (Marko Đurković)

- Registry informs about loaded patterns. (Florian Friesdorf)

- Renamed `patterns` folder to `pat`. Having `Patterns` mapped to
  `Patterns/src/main` this enables `requires['Patterns/pat/inject']. (Florian Friesdorf)

- Do not run javascript loaded in the document twice. This was causing
  problems with third party modules such as [shower](http://shwr.me/)
  and was not expected behaviour. [Ticket
  231](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/231).. (Wichert Akkerman)

- Auto-scale pattern: add new `min-width` and `max-width` options.
  [Ticket 242](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/242).
  (Wichert Akkerman)

- Tooltip pattern (Wichert Akkerman):

  - Change the options used to configure the tooltip. Part of
    [ticket 220](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/220).

  - Add new delay feature to postpone opening of tooltips on hover. Part of
    [ticket 220](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/220).

  - Add new option to set a class on the tooltip container. This allows for
    styling of individual tooltips. Part of
    [ticket 220](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues/220).
