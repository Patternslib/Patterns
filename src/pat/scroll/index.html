          From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br />
          That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br />
          But as the riper should by time decease,<br />
          His tender heir might bear his memory:<br />
          But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br />
          Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br />
          Making a famine where abundance lies,<br />
          Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br />
          Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<br />
          And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br />
          Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br />
          And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:<br />
          Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br />
          To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

        <p>
          When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br />
          And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br />
          Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,<br />
          Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:<br />
          Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br />
          Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br />
          To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br />
          Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br />
          How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,<br />
          If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br />
          Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'<br />
          Proving his beauty by succession thine.<br />
          This were to be new made when thou art old,<br />
          And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

          Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,<br />
          Now is the time that face should form another,<br />
          Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br />
          Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br />
          For where is she so fair whose uneared womb<br />
          Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br />
          Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,<br />
          Of his self-love to stop posterity?<br />
          Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee<br />
          Calls back the lovely April of her prime,<br />
          So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br />
          Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br />
          But if thou live remembered not to be,<br />
          Die single and thine image dies with thee.
