Pluggable patterns
==================


Markup patterns
---------------

Markup patterns never add or change any behaviour: their only purpose is to
add some convenience facilities over standard HTML to help with styling.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   autofocus
   checkedflag
   focus
   transforms


Behavioural patterns
--------------------

Behavioural patterns add extra behaviour to a page. This can be anything from
changing classes in a click, to doing complex AJAX injection of content.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   autoscale
   autosubmit
   bumper
   carousel
   checklist
   collapsible
   depends
   inject
   image-crop
   markdown
