Logging
=======

Patterns includes a minimal logging framework  to provide logging facilities.
To use this you will need to load the logging module and use its `getLogger`
method to get a log utility. This is typically done as part of the pattern
definition. The highlighted lines in the example below show the changes you
will need to make.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4,5,6,8

   define([
       'require'
       '../registry',
       '../core/logging',
   ], function(require, registry, logging) {
      var log = logging.getLogger("mypattern");
      ...
      log.info("Hello, world");
      ...
   });

Line 4 tells RequireJS that it needs to load the logging system. The logging
system will be provided as an extra parameter. In line 6 a log utility for
this pattern is requested. Finally in line 8 the log utility is used to log
a message.


Configuring through URL
-----------------------

To facilitate debugging you can change the default log level through the URL
query string by adding ``pat-loglevel`` options.

* ``http://www.example.com/?pat-loglevel=DEBUG`` changes the default log level
  to ``DEBUG``.
* ``http://www.example.com/?pat-loglevel-inject=DEBUG`` changes the log level
  for just the inject pattern to ``DEBUG``.
* ``http://www.example.com/?pat-loglevel=ERROR&pat-loglevel-inject=INFO``
  changes the standard log level error, but enables messages at the ``INFO``
  level for the inject pattern.


Logging API
-----------

.. js:attribute:: logging.Level

   An object which defines all available logging levels: ``DEBUG``, ``INFO``,
   ``WARN``, ``ERROR`` and ``FATAL``.


.. js:function:: logging.setEnabled(enabled)

   :param boolean enabled: flag indicating if logging should be enabled

   This function disables or enables all logging functionality.


.. js:function:: logging.setLevel(level)

   :param level: new logging level

   Use this function to change the root logging level. The default level is INFO. To
   change the level to DEBUG you can use this:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      logging.setLevel(logging.Level.DEBUG);

   Please note that this only changes the root logging level. You can set a
   different logging for individual loggers as well:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var log = logging.getLogger("mypattern");
      log.setLevel(logging.Level.DEBUG);


.. js:function:: logging.getLogger(name)

   :param string name: name of the logger
   :returns: a logger instance

   Retrieve, and optionally create, a named logger instance.


The logging object (`log` in the code example) exposes several methods to log
information at various log levels: 

* `debug` is used to log debug messages. These are normally not shown.
* `info` is used to log informational messages. These are normally not shown.
* `warn` is used to log warnings. These are normally shown.
* `error` is used to log errors. There are normally shown.
* `fatal` is used to log fatal errors. There are normally shown.
