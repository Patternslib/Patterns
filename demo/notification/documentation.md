#Notification

## Description
Notifications are used in applications to notify the user of status changes that happen within the application. Notifications could appear as inline messages, or projected (temporarily) as an overlay not he screen.

## Documentation
A standard notification requires the following markup:

    <p class="pat-notification">
      Hello world!
    </p>

It will render as a message box on the screen, with a small 'x' button with which the user may dismiss the notification.

If you want a Growl/Macos banner style message box that is super imposed on the screen, then consider the following markup:

    <p class="pat-notification" data-pat-notification="type: banner">
      Hello world!
    </p>
    
It's not necessary to use a `<p>` tag. Also a `<div class="pat-notification">` could be used with rich content inside. 

| Property | Values | Type | Description |

| `healing` | 'A value in seconds' `persistent` | Mutually exclusive | Enter a value in seconds for when the message should heal itself or choose persistent if only the user can dismiss the message. The default value is `5s` (Five seconds). | 
| 'controls' | `icons` `buttons` `none` | List | The value `icons` will display iconed controls. Typically styled in the top right corner of the message box.
