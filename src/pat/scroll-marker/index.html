          Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.
          Marty, will we ever see you again? I know what you're
          gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But
          Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid
          I'm not very good at confrontations. Right, and where
          am I gonna be? Great Scott. Let me see that
          photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought,
          this proves my theory, look at your brother.

          Where does he come from? There, there, now, just
          relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.
          Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They
          wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their
          plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case
          full of used pinball machine parts. Good, there's
          somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Marty, you
          seem so nervous, is something wrong?

          Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life
          depends on it. His head's gone, it's like it's been
          erased. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright
          this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come
          from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b,
          watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up,
          okay. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play.
          See that's where they kiss for the first time on the
          dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't
          dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and
          if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm
          history. Right, and where am I gonna be?

          Calvin. They're late. My experiment worked. They're
          all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. I guarantee it.
          No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a
          nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one
          gigawatts of electricity that I need. he's an idiot,
          comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots
          too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll
          disown you.

          That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get
          away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since
          high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Yes,
          definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now,
          you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for
          the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily
          ever after. I have to tell you about the future. That
          Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away
          with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high
          school. Although, if it wasn't for him- What a
          nightmare.
