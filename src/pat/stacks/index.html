<h2>Demo 2</h2>
<h3>Here the stacks pattern is used together with the scroll and bumper patterns.</h3>
<p>
<em>
The stacks pattern enables the tab-like behaviour as seen above. The scroll
pattern enables a smooth scroll towards the tabbed contend and the bumber
pattern lets the tabs stick to the top of the page when you scroll down.

                The council squatted upon the steps of the rostrum, while
                below them stood the prisoner and her two guards. I saw
                that one of the women was Sarkoja, and thus understood how
                she had been present at the hearing of the preceding day,
                the results of which she had reported to the occupants of
                our dormitory last night. Her attitude toward the captive
                was most harsh and brutal. When she held her, she sunk her
                rudimentary nails into the poor girl's flesh, or twisted
                her arm in a most painful manner.

                Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure.
                Skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands.
                So, too, it is, that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms, the Typhoon.
                It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.

                I said, pointing at the pine tops that hid the Martians. "Eh?" said he, turning. "I
                was explainin' these is vallyble." "Death!" I shouted.
                "Death is coming! Death!" and leaving him to digest that if
                he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man. At the
                corner I looked back. The soldier had left him, and he was
                still standing by his box, with the pots of orchids on the
                lid of it, and staring vaguely over the trees. No one in
                Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were.

                So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to
                find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was
                small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the
                house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds
                waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the
                middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving
                it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice
                the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she
                could, and soon found
