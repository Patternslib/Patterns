      <h3>Tablet 1</h3>
      <p>
        of him who knew the most of all men know;<br />
        who made the journey; heartbroken; reconciled;<br />
        <br />
        who knew the way things were before the Flood,<br />
        the secret things, the mystery; who went<br />
        <br />
        to the end of the earth, and over; who returned,<br />
        and wrote the story on a tablet of stone.<br />
        <br />
        He built Uruk. He built the keeping place<br />
        of Anu and Ishtar. The outer wall<br />
        <br />
        shines in the sun like brightest copper; the inner<br />
        wall is beyond the imagining of kings.<br />
