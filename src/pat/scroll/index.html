                    From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br>
                    That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br>
                    But as the riper should by time decease,<br>
                    His tender heir might bear his memory:<br>
                    But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
                    Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br>
                    Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
                    Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br>
                    Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<br>
                    And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br>
                    Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br>
                    And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:<br>
                    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br>
                    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

                    When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br>
                    And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br>
                    Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,<br>
                    Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:<br>
                    Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br>
                    Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br>
                    To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br>
                    Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br>
                    How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,<br>
                    If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br>
                    Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'<br>
                    Proving his beauty by succession thine.<br>
                    This were to be new made when thou art old,<br>
                    And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

                    Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,<br>
                    Now is the time that face should form another,<br>
                    Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br>
                    Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br>
                    For where is she so fair whose uneared womb<br>
                    Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br>
                    Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,<br>
                    Of his self-love to stop posterity?<br>
                    Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee<br>
                    Calls back the lovely April of her prime,<br>
                    So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br>
                    Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br>
                    But if thou live remembered not to be,<br>
                    Die single and thine image dies with thee.
